Hangman is a classic guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters, one at a time; for each incorrect guess, the guessing player draws a part of a stick figure, losing the game if the figure is completed before they guess the word. 
Key aspects of the Hangman game:
Gameplay:
The word-choosing player selects a word and represents it with dashes, indicating the number of letters. 
The guessing player suggests a letter. 
If the letter is in the word, it is revealed in the correct positions. 
If the letter is not in the word, a part of the stick figure is drawn (head, body, limbs). 
The game ends when the guessing player correctly guesses the word or when the stick figure is fully drawn. 
Objective:
To guess the secret word before the stick figure is completed. 
Variations:
Difficulty levels can be adjusted by changing the number of allowed guesses. 
Some versions allow guessing the whole word at once. 
The game can be played with phrases or sentences instead of single words. 
Educational Value:
Improves spelling skills by helping players identify letters in a word. 
Can be used to practice vocabulary and word recognition.
